Hi, Adam! I made this repo so we can communicate secretly!!

Hello Eli, what a pleasant surprise!

Thanks, Adam! I'm still figuring this out :)

I'm on the same end of figuring this out. Currently in Olin Library working on Assignment 2 for the class.  
Seems like a really useful one for organizing my pre-existing projects!
Happy Sunday!

Happy Sunday, Adam! I'm glad you are still active in our super-secret communication channel here!
Will you still be in Olin at noon? I plan to get there around then. Hope to see you!

Yes I will be! I packed my lunch so I will be around :)

Great! See you in a bit :)

Hi, Adam - when does the agroecology working group meet?

Hi Eli, sorry for the late response.
They are still trying to pin point a time to meet.
I don't believe it has been decided yet!

Adam, these examples of collaborative R are pretty cool!

I agree, I am throughly enjoying these illustrations in the poweropint!

Is there a way to use emojis in R?
