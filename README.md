Hi, Adam! I made this repo so we can communicate secretly!!

Hello Eli, what a pleasant surprise!

Thanks, Adam! I'm still figuring this out :)

I'm on the same end of figuring this out. Currently in Olin Library working on Assignment 2 for the class.  
Seems like a really useful one for organizing my pre-existing projects!
Happy Sunday!

Happy Sunday, Adam! I'm glad you are still active in our super-secret communication channel here!
Will you still be in Olin at noon? I plan to get there around then. Hope to see you!

Yes I will be! I packed my lunch so I will be around :)

Great! See you in a bit :)

Hi, Adam - when does the agroecology working group meet?

Hi Eli, sorry for the late response.
They are still trying to pin point a time to meet.
I don't believe it has been decided yet!

Okay, well let me know when you know!

Adam, these examples of collaborative R are pretty cool!

I agree, I am throughly enjoying these illustrations in the poweropint!

Is there a way to use emojis in R?

Hi Adam, this is Eli. We are currently in lab section and I am looking forward to seeing you again in lecture on Tuesday! Isn't this class so cool??

Hey Eli! Sorry for missing your pushes! I'm not sure if there are ways to use
emojis in R but I'm sure there is some package out there that can help insert them!
Btw, this class is amazing! I enjoyed reading your flying dreams during lecture today as well :)
See you on Tuesday!
